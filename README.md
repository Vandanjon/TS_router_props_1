# React + TS tutorial

Want to start typescript but have no idea how to go about it?

This tiny project is the way to go:

1. check commits changes
2. clone the repo and start it to see what each file does
3. try to refacto some components to give a try to SOLID principles (don't hesitate to add new ones)
4. dive deeper in react : use components life cycle to better fetch datas (useEffect, useState...)
